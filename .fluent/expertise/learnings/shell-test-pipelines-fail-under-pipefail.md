description: Shell behavior tests run under set -euo pipefail, so a short-circuiting consumer like grep -q gives the producer SIGPIPE (exit 141) and fails the pipeline; match in-process instead
metadata:
  type: gotcha
---

The shell scripts under `tests/behaviors/` run with `set -euo pipefail`. Inside
that mode any pipeline whose consumer exits early can fail even when the logic
is correct: `printf '%s' "$1" | grep -Fq -- "$2"` short-circuits `grep` on the
first match, `printf` then dies with `SIGPIPE` (exit 141), and `pipefail`
propagates that non-zero `PIPESTATUS` as the pipeline's status. Against large
multi-line output the matcher exits on an early line and the producer is still
writing, so a *present* literal yields a false negative (`PIPESTATUS 141 0`).

Prefer in-process Bash matching over a producer-consumer pipeline for
containment checks: `[[ "$1" == *"$2"* ]]` (and `!=` for the inverse). Quote the
needle (`"$2"`) so pattern metacharacters like `*` and `[` stay literal, and
leave the surrounding `*` unquoted so they remain the wildcards that span the
haystack. No pipeline means nothing to receive `SIGPIPE`.

When regression-testing this class of fix, make it mutation-sensitive: build a
deterministic haystack larger than a pipe buffer (>1 MiB via a doubling loop)
with the literal on an early line to reproduce the SIGPIPE timing, and add a
metacharacter case (needle `a*b` against `aZZb`) so unquoting the needle
visibly reverses the outcome. Suppress the helper's own `FAIL:`/`Output:`
diagnostic (`> /dev/null 2>&1`) on the sub-checks you expect to fail so the
multi-megabyte value is not dumped.
